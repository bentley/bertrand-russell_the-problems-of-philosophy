			<p>In the following pages I have confined myself in the main to those problems of philosophy in regard to which I thought it possible to say something positive and constructive, since merely negative criticism seemed out of place. For this reason, theory of knowledge occupies a larger space than metaphysics in the present volume, and some topics much discussed by philosophers are treated very briefly, if at all.</p>
			<p>I have derived valuable assistance from unpublished writings of <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G. E.</abbr> Moore and <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J. M.</abbr> Keynes: from the former, as regards the relations of sense-data to physical objects, and from the latter as regards probability and induction. I have also profited greatly by the criticisms and suggestions of Professor Gilbert Murray.</p>
